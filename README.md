# Machine Learning

Thanks for reading this repository. If it's helpful to you, you can click ✨Star✨ to facilitate future search and reading.

In terms of content, this publication will update machine learning related learning documents from time to time, but I prefer to create my own knowledge system, so part of  contents may not be directly related to machine learning, or some that should be included but not involved (convex optimization), I hope you can understand it. The related content partly comes from my own learning and understanding, and partly comes from the Internet. Regarding the content of the quotation, I have marked the place, and I'd be appreciated if you can state the sources when citing the articles from this repository. 

In terms of format, the writing is mainly written in Markdown, and I also tried to achieve the unity of the format. You can easily browse through the document catalog of titles, the hierarchical title catalog on the right (in yuque) and the hyperlinks inside the documents.

Due to my limited ability and time, it is inevitable that there will be errors in content and format. I hope readers can point out that I will modify it in time.
